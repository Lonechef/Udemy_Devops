=> So basically our backend is deployed via Apprunner
-> And Frontend is deployed via CDF
-> So basically now what we will do is basically all the end points having "/api"
-> Should be served by Apprunner where basically our Node Js has been deployed
-> So for this first we need to go to cdf in that we have a origin so we need to 
create new origin and in that we need to give the link of apprunner where our backend
has been deployed
-> So further we need to go to behavivour and Create behaviour in that we nothing need to do
-> Simply we need to mentionn  the path for our case it is /api/* basically this means 
any path having api will be directed to aws apprunner and further we can mention which HTTP
Method can be allowed 
-> ANother policy we need to mentiuon is "AllViewExceptHostHeader"
-> This menas when we call from frontend to backedn we want all the headers to pass except host headers
