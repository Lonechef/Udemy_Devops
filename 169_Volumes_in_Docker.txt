-> Volumes in Docker
-> So as seen previosuly we donot update the Docker COntainer instead we update it 
-> But issue is with the data like creatuing a new continer but what about data inside the continer
-> What is a volume?
-> Its a mechanism for mapping container data to a (hidden) directory on the host
-> So basically lets say opur system or host is of linux then basically the data inside the conatainer is linked to the hiddebn folder inn the host
-> On Linux the volumes are usually stored under:
/var/lib/docker/volumes 
-> Also we should never acess them directly instead we should access them with docker volumen only
-> To create a new volume we simply do
-> "docker volume create nginx-vol"
-> Ro see the docker volume we do : docker volume ls`
-> To inspect we use  "docker volume inspect ngix-vol"
-> To remove the volume we do " dcker volume rs ngix-vol "
-> Its is not possible to create a volume if we want to do that then we need to create a new volume and then copy all files into it
-> To delete all the unused volumes we do " docker volume prune"
