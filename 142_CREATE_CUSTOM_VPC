-> So in this first we will try to create VPC by going into VPC in aws
-> So click on create Vpc this will be completely diff VPC 
-> Here we will select VPC & more main reason this will help us to create subnet and all other wise we need to manually create them
-> So in that we have an option to select the availability zone so basically in this which mean in what all zone our VPC will be available 
-> Now anoter optoin is to create Public & Private Subnet
->Public Subnet :
-> Has a route to an Internet Gateway
-> This allows resources EC2 to acess the internet
-> PRIVATE sUBNET:
-> Does not have direct acess to the Internet Gateway
-> Resources are private 
-> And further Click on Create VPC it will create the VPC now we need to create an EC2 instance 
-> So we want to launch 2 EC2 instance so we will give name and select 2 instance and now main part is in Networking Section in select the VPN you created 
-> So for now I will select the Project-vpc that we created and then will select the Subnet
-> Now enable trhe Auto assign 
-> Inbound security group I will selcte All traffic for now but this is not recommended for Production 
-> Now create INstace in this way the instance will be created so basically now we have 2 instance runninbg on same VPC booth instannce have difeetent IP so Basically
-> Now select any one of the instance so we can do it by ssh@IPV4 or select that Instane and above we have a connect option so we by using that we would connect thata
-> So this will cli for us in aws itself 
-> And now we will take the privateb Ipv4 for another instance and would try to ping it which is present in our VPC and hence it will get  connected 
-> So basically as both our instace are present in single VPC so hence due to which from one instance to another ionstance we can connect by using another instance private Ip
-> But if we try to connect the instance which is in diff VPC then we will not able to connect 
-> Basically VPC becomes that area where servers present in that area can connect to eachother 
->
