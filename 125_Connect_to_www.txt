So in this previous lecture we connected AWS Apprunner to our custom domain
Now lets see if we want to add www i.e our sub domain to this
So furst we need to go to our Link Custom DOamin in that currently we donot have any 
for www so we would create it first so in "Hosted Zone " we need to create
So after you hosted the server You will be able to find Name Servers
Copy that Name Servers THis is because our www subdomain is not connected
To our main hosted Zone So Now we need to create a Record for that
"Now in Record Type" Selecte Name Server for hosted Zone and paste the names
Now go to Aws App runned now in Domain registrar you will be able to find www
And the crerate Domain although when you click on the link this still
won't be working (although this will take time it will get by own only)
