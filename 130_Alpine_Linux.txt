-> The Linux Distribution : Alpine Linux
This is basically a small linux Distribution 
Often used as base image for many images
Good alternative of Debian
SO to start with we would run linux alpine on our sytem
"docker run -it --rm alpine"
-> Alpine is just 8mb which we can say that this is very lean linux distribution system
-> Also in alpine other images like python this are also of lesser size
"docker pull python:alpine" : This will pull python image based on alpine
-> Hence we can say Using Alpine based linux the size of image are quite less hence which will help us to speed up the deployment
