-> So now for this we will need the Code Build so in Aws search for Code Build
-> So in Aws go to code Build and then go to Create Project 
-> Further we need to select the Source so our Source is Github
-> Also we need to  enable Webhook event so this will basically so any change in code will redeploy it
-> And in Filter Group we need to add "Push" this means whenever code is pushed the deployment will begin again
-> Now in BuildSpec we will find a yaml file where all commands can be written
-> Basically this should contain the the script that we wrote in deploy.sh 
-> This should be kept under "pre_build" phase so there are three phases 
1.pre_build
2. Build
3. post_build
-> So after building this you will get a error regarding the authorization in that Case what
we need to do is basically go to our Iam user and grant permission related to ec2 stuff
-> So basically we need to add this policy -> 'AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser'
