- Websites can be hosted directly using S3 by enabling the "Static Website Hosting" option in the bucket's properties.
- Instead of using S3 directly, CloudFront will be used for this purpose.
- CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service provided by AWS.
- It delivers content with low latency and high transfer speeds by caching copies of content at edge locations globally.
- This improves the performance and availability of websites or applications for users worldwide.
