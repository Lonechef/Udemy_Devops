So till Now basically what we have done is uploaded our imgae into ECR and that ECR is now connected
to AWS Apprunner and hence any change in ECR image will affect and the automatic deployment will begin
Now in this we will focus on writting the script in our Docker file in such a way that any change in code 
will directly upload it to ECR and furthrt ad autmatic deployment is enabled so it will get automatically deployed
-> So firste we need to make file called as deploy.sh in our folder
-> Also that shell script shoiuld not be uploaded so we will add it to dockerignore
-> Adding Belown code
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo 'Starting Deployment...'

Now in terminal We need to write : chmod +x deploy.sh //This will make my file executable

And further we write ./deploy.sh then it will say Startimng deployment that menas out that script is up and runnning

So now first add the Login "Push Command" in you shell script

->> So further simply in step 2 add all the push commads in step 3 
we will siply do cleanup in that docker image rm <Tag>


So now we do ./deploy.sh then new code will get uploaded to ecr and further the deployment will begin
