-> Multi Stage Build
-> This will help us to have build Stage and an execution Stage
-> We will create all executable files in temporary container   
-> we then copy those into a smaller image
-> This  image will then contain the components that are needed during execution(but no contianer)
-> So for that in docker file we will have multiple from commands
-> What is the primary benefit of using multi-stage builds in Docker?
-> Reduced Image size by copying only the necessary files
