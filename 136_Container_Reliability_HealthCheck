-> So now we would include health check in this
-> So basically for health check 
-> The command  should exit 0 if everything is okay 
-> The command will exit with code 1 if some error occured

# Adding Health Check if Status Code: 0 then it is healthy if 1 then unhealthy
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost: || exit 1

# More Perfect health Check 
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=30s --start-period=1s --start-interval=5s --retries=3 CMD curl -f http://localhost: || exit 1
# So as soon as the container starts this will start and will wait for 5secs if any error and it will take 3  retries
